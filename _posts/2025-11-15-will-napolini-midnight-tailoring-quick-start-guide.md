Let’s get crafting.

## PROFESSION OVERVIEW

To create any item in the game, you'll need reagents. The quality of crafted items depends on your profession skill and the quality of materials you use — the higher your skill, the higher the final quality.

> *The higher your **SKILL**, the less **Concentration** you need to spend to craft high-quality items. A higher skill level also allows you to use lower-rank reagents to achieve high-quality results.*

In the latest expansions, professions are also influenced by factors such as:

- Chosen specialization (except Cooking, Fishing and Archaeology)
- Quality of tools and accessories used

Understanding these rules is one thing, but navigating the *most efficient path* to max skill is another. Wasting reagents on the wrong recipes is a classic gold sink—which is exactly what we'll avoid next. 

Let's map out your optimal leveling guide.

### PROFESSION TRAINER

You can learn *Midnight* Tailoring from **[Galana](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=243352)** in **Silvermoon City**.

![Tailoring Trainer Location in Silvermoon City](1.png)

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Each main profession has 8 Knowledge Point Treasures (2 per zone, 3 KPs per treasure, 24 KPs total), except Cooking, Fishing, and Archaeology.


### ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES

First things first, let's talk about your tools. In *Midnight*, they are more critical than ever. It's not just about leveling up—high-quality tools are essential for saving gold and maximizing your long-term earnings.

A high-quality tool provides three crucial benefits:

1.  It boosts your **SKILL**, which directly determines the quality of the items you produce.
2.  It provides a chance to save reagents on every craft, making your precious materials go further.
3.  It increases **the speed of your gathering and the yield** you collect from **Herbalism and Mining**.

Because of this, acquiring the best tools you can afford is a top priority. Think of it as a foundational investment that pays dividends every time you craft or gather.

#### Available Tools and Accessories:

| Slot | Crafted by | Green | Blue | Epic |
|------|------------|-------|------|------|
| Accessory 1 | Blacksmithing | [Thalassian Needle Set](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=237946) | [Sun-Blessed Needle Set](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=237950) | [Sunforged Needle Set](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259234) |
| Accessory 2 | Tailoring | [Bright Linen Tailoring Robe](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=239646) | [Elegant Artisan's Tailoring Robe](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=239640) | [Super Elegant Artisan's Tailoring Robe](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=246514) |
| Tool | Engineering | [Farstrider Fabric Cutters](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244707) | [Sin'dorei Snippers](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244708) | [Super Sin'dorei Snippers](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259177) |

To get started, here is a breakdown of the essential tools and the best enchantments for them:

**High-End Tools (Long-Term Goal)**

I recommend: [Super Sin'dorei Snippers](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259177)

**For Single Items (like Gear):**

I go with **double Resourcefulness**: 
- [Resourcefulness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245817/thalassian-missive-of-resourcefulness) 
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243967/enchant-tool-amani-resourcfulness)

This combo saves you materials when every craft counts.

**For Stackable Stuff (like Reagents):**

This is where I switch to:
- [Multicraft Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245819/thalassian-missive-of-multicraft)
- [Multicraft Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243995/enchant-tool-haranir-multicrafting)

You get the best of both worlds - saving mats AND sometimes getting bonus items!

#### Here's What Actually Happened in My Test:

So, I got enough reagents to make 1000x [Bright Linen Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1228939):

- **With my single-item setup:** I got 1478x [Bright Linen Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1228939)
- **With my stackable-item setup:** I got 1652x [Bright Linen Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1228939)

The difference was pretty clear - the Multicraft setup just gives you more bang for your buck when making stuff in bulk.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Have two tools! One for gear (double Resourcefulness) and one for commodities (double Multicraft). Trust me, it's worth it.

## CONCLUSION

Mastering Tailoring in *Midnight* opens up multiple pathways to success, depending on your playstyle and goals. Whether you're building the perfect **alt-army concentration setup** for efficient profession cycling, optimizing a **gold-making setup** for maximum profit, or focusing on **cloth-farming** for self-sufficiency, this guide has given you the foundation to excel.

**Choose Your Specialization Path:**

- **Alt-Army Concentration Setup**: Focus on [Sin'dorei Finery](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/profession-trait/sindorei-finery-104216) and essential patterns that require minimal time investment but provide maximum value for multiple characters
- **Gold-Making Setup**: Target high-demand commodities like bags, spellthreads, and profession gear using optimized multicraft tools to maximize profit margins
- **Cloth-Farming Specialization**: Combine with gathering professions to create a self-sufficient economic engine, supplying your own materials while dominating the cloth markets

**Pro Tip for Serious Crafters:** The most successful tailors maintain multiple specialization setups. Keep one set of tools configured for your **alt-army concentration** needs (quick, efficient crafts) and another for your **gold-making setup** (multicraft-optimized mass production). For **cloth-farming** enthusiasts, remember that unraveling old gear can often be more profitable than selling it outright.
