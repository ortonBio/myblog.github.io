Let’s get crafting.

## PROFESSION OVERVIEW

To create any item in the game, you'll need reagents. The quality of crafted items depends on your profession skill and the quality of materials you use — the higher your skill, the higher the final quality.

> *The higher your **SKILL**, the less **Concentration** you need to spend to craft high-quality items. A higher skill level also allows you to use lower-rank reagents to achieve high-quality results.*

In the latest expansions, professions are also influenced by factors such as:

- Chosen specialization (except Cooking, Fishing and Archaeology)
- Quality of tools and accessories used

Understanding these rules is one thing, but navigating the *most efficient path* to max skill is another. Wasting reagents on the wrong recipes is a classic gold sink—which is exactly what we'll avoid next. 

Let's map out your optimal leveling guide.

### PROFESSION TRAINER

You can learn *Midnight* Engineering from **[Danwe](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=241452/danwe)** in **Silvermoon City**.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Each main profession has 8 Knowledge Point Treasures (2 per zone, 3 KPs per treasure, 24 KPs total), except Cooking, Fishing, and Archaeology.


### ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES

First things first, let's talk about your tools. In *Midnight*, they are more critical than ever. It's not just about leveling up—high-quality tools are essential for saving gold and maximizing your long-term earnings.

A high-quality tool provides three crucial benefits:

1.  It boosts your **SKILL**, which directly determines the quality of the items you produce.
2.  It provides a chance to save reagents on every craft, making your precious materials go further.
3.  It increases **the speed of your gathering and the yield** you collect from **Herbalism and Mining**.

Because of this, acquiring the best tools you can afford is a top priority. Think of it as a foundational investment that pays dividends every time you craft or gather.

#### Available Tools and Accessories:

| Slot | Crafted by | Green | Blue | Epic |
|------|------------|-------|------|------|
| Accessory 1 | Engineering | [Junker's Junk Visor](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244709) | [Sin'dorei Headlamp](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244710) | [Super Sin'dorei Headlamp](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259171) |
| Accessory 2 | Leatherworking | [Apprentice Smith's Apron](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244627/apprentice-smiths-apron) | [Sin'dorei Forgemaster's Cover](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244628/sindorei-forgemasters-cover) | [Thalassian Ironbender's Regalia](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244813/thalassian-ironbenders-regalia) |
| Tool | Engineering | [Junker's Multitool](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244717) | [Turbo-Junker's Multitool](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244718) | [Super Turbo-Junker's Multitool](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259183) |

To get started, here is a breakdown of the essential tools and the best enchantments for them:

**High-End Tools (Long-Term Goal)**

I recommend: [Super Turbo-Junker's Multitool](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259183)

**For Single Items (like Gear):**

I go with **double Resourcefulness**: 
- [Resourcefulness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245817/thalassian-missive-of-resourcefulness) 
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243967/enchant-tool-amani-resourcfulness)

This combo saves you materials when every craft counts.

**For Stackable Stuff (like Reagents):**

This is where I switch to:
- [Multicraft Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245819/thalassian-missive-of-multicraft)
- [Multicraft Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243995/enchant-tool-haranir-multicrafting)

You get the best of both worlds - saving mats AND sometimes getting bonus items!

#### Here's What Actually Happened in My Test:

So, I got enough reagents to make 1000x [Song Gear](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1229755):

- **With my Resourcefulness setup:** I got 1478x [Song Gear](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1229755)
- **With my Multicraft setup:** I got 1652x [Song Gear](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1229755)

The difference was pretty clear - the Multicraft setup just gives you more bang for your buck when making stuff in bulk.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Have two tools! One for gear (double Resourcefulness) and one for commodities (double Multicraft). Trust me, it's worth it.

## CONCLUSION

Congratulations! You now have everything you need to level Engineering efficiently in *Midnight* — from your first craft at skill 1 to maxing out at 100.

Here's what we covered:

**The Foundation:**
- Essential tools with the right enchants (double Resourcefulness for gear, double Multicraft for commodities)
- A clear, tested leveling path that won't waste your gold on dead-end recipes
- The exact shopping list to get you from 1-50 without backtracking

**The Reality:**
Most players stumble through professions, burning gold on outdated advice and inefficient routes. You're not most players anymore.

**But here's the thing** — this guide gets you *started*. It gives you the foundation. What it doesn't give you is the cutting-edge intel that separates casual crafters from gold-making machines.

That's where the community comes in.

**Inside our Telegram community, you'll find:**
- **Patch-tested leveling exploits** that cut your time in half
- **Real goldfarming strategies** with exact routes and multipliers
- **Auction House tactics** that top sellers actually use (not the generic "buy low, sell high" nonsense)
- **Early access to profession changes** before they hit live servers

*World of Warcraft* doesn't stand still. Patches drop. Metas shift. Materials spike and crash.

**The question is simple:** Do you want to react to changes, or stay ahead of them?
