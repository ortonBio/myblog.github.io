Let’s get crafting.

## PROFESSION OVERVIEW

To create any item in the game, you'll need reagents. The quality of crafted items depends on your profession skill and the quality of materials you use — the higher your skill, the higher the final quality.

> *The higher your **SKILL**, the less **Concentration** you need to spend to craft high-quality items. A higher skill level also allows you to use lower-rank reagents to achieve high-quality results.*

In the latest expansions, professions are also influenced by factors such as:

- Chosen specialization (except Cooking, Fishing and Archaeology)
- Quality of tools and accessories used

Understanding these rules is one thing, but navigating the *most efficient path* to max skill is another. Wasting reagents on the wrong recipes is a classic gold sink—which is exactly what we'll avoid next. 

Let's map out your optimal leveling guide.

### PROFESSION TRAINER

You can learn *Midnight* Cooking from **[Sylann](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=257913/sylann)** in **Silvermoon City**.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:**
> [Tavern Fixings](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=242647) and [Pouch of Spices](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=242646) is sold by [Quelis](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=257914/quelis), the cooking supplies vendor near the trainer.


### ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES

First things first, let's talk about your tools. In *Midnight*, they are more critical than ever. It's not just about leveling up—high-quality tools are essential for saving gold and maximizing your long-term earnings.

A high-quality tool provides three crucial benefits:

1.  It boosts your **SKILL**, which directly determines the quality of the items you produce.
2.  It provides a chance to save reagents on every craft, making your precious materials go further.
3.  It increases **the speed of your gathering and the yield** you collect from **Herbalism and Mining**.

Because of this, acquiring the best tools you can afford is a top priority. Think of it as a foundational investment that pays dividends every time you craft or gather.

#### Available Tools and Accessories:

| Slot | Crafted by | Green | Blue | Epic |
|------|------------|-------|------|------|
| Accessory | Tailoring | [Chef's Bright Linen Cooking Chapeau](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=239642) | [Elegant Artisan's Cooking Hat](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=239636) | [Super Elegant Artisan's Cooking Hat](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=246522) |
| Tool | Inscription | [Hobbyist Rolling Pin](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245779) | [Sin'dorei Rolling Pin](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245780) | [Super Sin'dorei Rolling Pin](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259207) |


To get started, here is a breakdown of the essential tools and the best enchantments for them:

**High-End Tools (Long-Term Goal)**

I recommend: [Super Sin'dorei Rolling Pin](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259207/super-sindorei-rolling-pin)

**For Ingredients:**

I go with **Resourcefulness**: 

- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243967/enchant-tool-amani-resourcfulness)

This combo saves you materials when every craft counts.

**For Stackable Stuff (like Food or Drink):**

This is where I switch to:

- [Multicraft Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243995/enchant-tool-haranir-multicrafting)

You get the best of both worlds - saving mats AND sometimes getting bonus items!

#### Here's What Actually Happened in My Test:

So, I got enough reagents to make 1000x [Silvermoon Parade](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1257796/silvermoon-parade):

- **With my Resourcefulness setup:** I got 2478x [Silvermoon Parade](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1257796/silvermoon-parade)
- **With my Multicraft setup:** I got 2652x [Silvermoon Parade](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1257796/silvermoon-parade)

The difference was pretty clear - the multicraft setup just gives you more bang for your buck when making stuff in bulk.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Have two tools—one for maximum [Resourcefulness](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1265693/resourcefulness) and one for maximum [Multicraft](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1265601/multicraft). Trust me, it's worth it.

## CONCLUSION

**You've just saved yourself hours of trial-and-error—and probably thousands of gold.**

With this leveling path, you now have exactly what you need to hit Skill 100 efficiently, without wasting reagents on outdated or inefficient recipes. You know which tools matter, where to get them, and how to optimize your setup for both cost savings and maximum output.

But here's the reality: **leveling is just the beginning.**

The *real* profit in Cooking comes from knowing:
- Which recipes are selling *right now* on your realm
- What to stockpile before the next patch or raid tier drops
- How to leverage event bonuses and market cycles for maximum gold per hour

That's the difference between someone who *knows* Cooking and someone who *dominates* it.
