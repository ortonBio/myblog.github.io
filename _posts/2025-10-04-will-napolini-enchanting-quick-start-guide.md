## Enchanting Trainer

*You can learn the War Within Enchanting skill from the Enchanting trainer in **Dornogal**.*

## Enchanting Tools

First things first, let's talk about your tools. In The War Within, they play a much bigger role than before. It's not just about leveling up—your tools are key to saving gold and earning more in the long run.

A high-quality tool does two crucial things for an Enchanter:

1. It boosts your skill, which directly increases the quality of reagents you get from disenchanting gear.
2. It gives you a chance to save reagents every time you craft an enchant, meaning each precious material goes further.

Because of this, getting the best tools you can afford will be one of your main priorities. Think of it as a foundational investment that pays off every time you open your profession window.

To get started, here's a breakdown of the essential tools and the best enchantments for them:

High-End Tools (Long-Term Goal)

· Tool Name: [Runed Null Stone Rod](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=224116)

· Best Enchantment: 

- [Resourcefulness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222631) 
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223707)

and

- [Multicraft Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222634)
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223707)
 
· Why: Briefly explain why this is the best combo for end-game crafting.

Starter / Low-End Tools (Good to use now)

· Tool Name: [Runed Bismuth Rod](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=224114)

· Best Enchantment: 

- [Resourcefulness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222631) 
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223707)

· Why: Explain that this is a great temporary setup while working towards the high-end tools.

You get the best of both worlds - saving mats AND sometimes getting bonus items!

#### Here's What Actually Happened in My Test:

So, I got enough reagents to make 1000x [Mirror Powder](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224176):

- **With my single-item setup (38% Resourcefulness and 8% Multicraft):** I got 1395x [Mirror Powder](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224176)
- **With my stackable-item setup (21% Resourcefulness and 22% Multicraft):** I got 1549x [Mirror Powder](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224176)

The difference was pretty clear - the multicraft setup just gives you more bang for your buck when making stuff in bulk.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Have two tools! One for gear enchants (double resourcefulness) and one for commodities (multicraft + resourcefulness). Trust me, it's worth it.

## Shopping List
These are the approximate materials required to reach **80**. The 80-100 part is not included because there are many alternatives from Drops, Vendors, and Specializations.

*   **885x** [Storm Dust](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219946)
*   **23x** [Leyline Residue](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213613)
*   **40x** [Viridescent Spores](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213612)
*   **165x** [Gleaming Shard](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219949)
*   **10x** [Ringing Deeps Ingot](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221754)
*   **20x** [Refulgent Crystal](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219952)
*   **50x** [Enchanting Vellum](https://www.wowhead.com/item=38682)

## Leveling Khaz Algar Enchanting

### Racials
*   **Blood Elf**: +5 Enchanting skill
*   **Kul Tiran**: +2 Enchanting skill

More Enchanting skill means more orange recipe skill-ups, saving gold and improving high-quality reagent chances from disenchanting.

### Disenchanting
Disenchant any leftover gear from questing or dungeons before you start leveling. Disenchanting can give skill points up to 25.

### Below is my step-by-step leveling guide:

Our goal is to unlock [Shimmering Dust](https://www.wowhead.com/item=227662) for KP's catch-up and [Artisan's Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210814/artisans-acuity)

#### First Step:

Disenchant x10-15 [Pioneer's Cloth Cuffs](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222833) or any other TWW gear until you get x5 [Fleeting Arcane Manifestation](https://www.wowhead.com/item=227659) and x1 [Gleaming Telluric Crystal](https://www.wowhead.com/item=227661)

#### Step Two:

Depending on the week, there are 3 Enchanting quests that will be available from [Nagad](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=219085/nagad) when you hit 25 skill:

1. [A Rare Necessity](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=84086/a-rare-necessity) - Requires x1 [Refulgent Crystal](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219952/refulgent-crystal)

2. [Just a Pinch](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=84084/just-a-pinch) - Requires x20 [Storm Dust](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219946/storm-dust)

3. [The Power of Potential](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=84085/the-power-of-potential) - Requires x10 [Gleaming Shard](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219949/gleaming-shard)

#### Step Three:

When you complete the quest, head out of Dornogal and loot [Crystalline Repository](https://www.wowhead.com/item=225230) and [Powdered Fulgurance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=225231) from [Earthbound Geode](https://www.wowhead.com/object=444091). When you do this, [Shimmering Dust](https://www.wowhead.com/item=227662) will be unlocked and you're ready to go further.

![Earthbound Geode Map](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759959884/will-napolini-enchanting-quick-start-guide-map-earthbound-geode_tzsgze.png)

> **Pro Tip:** [Myu's Weak Aura](https://wago.io/L7lpDrqUO) for tracking Profession Knowledge. Fantastic for tracking available profession knowledge, especially catchup.

### First Craft Bonus & Specialization
You will receive **1x Khaz Algar Enchanting Knowledge** the first time you craft any recipe. When you get 25 skill you will unlock Specializations.

## 1 - 25

From 1 to 25 I use Disenchanting or Shattering

![Skill 1-25](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1762290539/will-napolini-enchanting-quick-start-guide-skill-1-25_o6z43u.png)

## 25 - 47 (Recommended Path)

By allocating **5 points** into the **Ephemerals, Enrichments, and Equipment** specialization and then **15 points** into the **[Deceptive Decorations](https://www.wowhead.com/profession-trait/99939)** sub-specialization, you'll unlock **22 new recipes**.

![Deceptive Decorations](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1762291620/will-napolini-enchanting-quick-start-guide-skill-25-50_p5caid.png) 

These recipes are consumable items that transform you into another race, such as the [Gleeful Glamour - Worgen](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=445397), which changes you into a Worgen. You can earn First Craft bonuses from all of these recipes, totaling 22 knowledge points for the 20 you invest, along with around 23 Enchanting skill points. 

### 25 - 47

![Gleeful Glamour](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1762292008/will-napolini-enchanting-quick-start-guide-skill-25-50-gleeful-glamours_yppfgf.png) 


Create each Gleeful Glamour available: 

* 22x [Leyline Residue](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213613)  
* 22x [Viridescent Spores](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213612)  
* 110x [Storm Dust](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219946)


### 47 - 50

![Enchanted Spearwood Wand](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1762292254/will-napolini-enchanting-quick-start-guide-skill-47-wand_x3ddnv.png) 

**Create:** x1 [Enchanted Spearwood Wand](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=445324)

**Required:**
- 5x [Storm Dust]()
- 1x [Codified Greenwood]()

### 50 - 78

From 50 to 70, we are going to craft [Concentration Concentrate](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224173/concentration-concentrate), which we unlock in our chosen specialization:

![Specialization](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1762294816/will-napolini-enchanting-quick-start-guide-skill-50-70_ts7epo.png) 

> **Pro Tip:**  For the Knowledge Point catch-up, use [Shimmering Dust](https://www.wowhead.com/item=227662) you get from Disenchanting.


![Skill 50-75](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1762295406/will-napolini-enchanting-quick-start-guide-skill-50-70-concentration_rxiovl.png)

- 40x [Viridescent Spores](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213612)



### 75 - 100

From 75 to 100, we are going to craft Weapon Enchantments that are in high demand, such as [Authority of Storms](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=445336/authority-of-storms) in my example:

![Skill 50-75](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1762296753/will-napolini-enchanting-quick-start-guide-skill-75-100_h1epzw.png)

**Create:** x5-10 [Authority of Storms](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223770/enchant-weapon-authority-of-storms)

**Required:**

- 10x [Ringing Deeps Ingot](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221754/ringing-deeps-ingot)



### 80 - 88 (Optional)

With the [Midnight]() expansion update introduces two new *[Housing Decor]()* recipes, learnable at skill 80 and turning green around skill 87-88, which require [Dornic Fir Lumber](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=248012/dornic-fir-lumber) harvested from trees in and beneath Khaz Algar.

- [Dornogal Hanging Sconce](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1259715/dornogal-hanging-sconce)

- [Replica Awakening Machine Stasis Pod](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1259690/replica-awakening-machine-stasis-pod)

#### VENDORS BOOKS

The treasures are great, but the real knowledge jackpot comes from the books you can buy. Just like the treasures, these are **one-time purchases per character**. Once you buy them, they're gone from the vendor for you.
