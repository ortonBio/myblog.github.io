## TomTom Addon

While it's not mandatory, I highly recommend using the **TomTom addon** to make collecting these treasures much easier. TomTom is a super helpful addon that simplifies finding NPCs or objects when coordinates are provided, which you'll often see in my guides and elsewhere.

You can download TomTom from **[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom)**, or if you use the CurseForge app, just install it inside the app.

### How to Use TomTom Addon

Once you've downloaded and installed the TomTom addon, you can easily use the `/ttpaste` command in-game to open a window where you can paste the list of "/way" commands listed under each profession.

Here's how to do it step by step:

1. **Copy** the list of "/way" commands from the guide for your chosen profession.
2. Switch back to WoW and type `/ttpaste` into the chat. Make sure there's no space before it, and include the `/`.
3. **Paste** the list of "/way" commands into the window.
4. Press the **"Paste"** button at the bottom of the window.
5. Now, you'll see little **green dots** on your world map, indicating the treasure locations. There will be **two treasures for each zone**.

If this doesn't work for you, you can also copy and paste the lines one by one into your chat without using the "ttpaste" command. Like this:
```
/way #2339 99.4, 88.3 Vial of Voidstorm Oddities (Alchemy)
```

### Treasure Checks

You can use the treasure check commands in each section to see if you've already looted an item. Simply paste the commands into the same `/ttpaste` window, or enter them one by one in the chat. If the command returns **'true,'** it means you've already collected that treasure.

## Important Notes

### Minimap Icons
These treasures will show up as **Treasure icons** on your minimap when you're nearby, making them easy to find. However, if a treasure is inside a building, it might not always appear on your minimap, so you may need to search around a bit more.

### Profession Skill Requirement
You **must have the profession** to be able to see the treasures, but there is **no profession skill requirement**. You can loot them with just **skill 1**.

### Character Level
You can loot the treasures at a lower level; you **don't need to be max level**. Start collecting as soon as you enter the *Midnight* zones.
