Let’s get crafting.

## PROFESSION OVERVIEW

To create any item in the game, you'll need reagents. The quality of crafted items depends on your profession skill and the quality of materials you use — the higher your skill, the higher the final quality.

> *The higher your **SKILL**, the less **Concentration** you need to spend to craft high-quality items. A higher skill level also allows you to use lower-rank reagents to achieve high-quality results.*

In the latest expansions, professions are also influenced by factors such as:

- Chosen specialization (except Cooking, Fishing and Archaeology)
- Quality of tools and accessories used

Understanding these rules is one thing, but navigating the *most efficient path* to max skill is another. Wasting reagents on the wrong recipes is a classic gold sink—which is exactly what we'll avoid next. 

Let's map out your optimal leveling guide.

### PROFESSION TRAINER

You can learn *Midnight* Jewelcrafting from **[Amin](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=243345/amin)** in **Silvermoon City**.

![Jewelcrafting Trainer Location in Silvermoon City](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1761414098/will-napolini-Jewelcrafting-quick-start-guide-trainer-map_nejowg.png)

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Additionally, the [Weaver’s Tutelage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=442981) and [Weaver’s Prodigy](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=462810) buffs, unlocked through [reputation with the Severed Threads faction](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/renown/the-severed-threads), offer a 15% and 30% crafting speed increase respectively, making them highly valuable for mass crafting.


### ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES

First things first, let's talk about your tools. In *Midnight*, they are more critical than ever. It's not just about leveling up—high-quality tools are essential for saving gold and maximizing your long-term earnings.

A high-quality tool provides three crucial benefits:

1.  It boosts your **SKILL**, which directly determines the quality of the items you produce.
2.  It provides a chance to save reagents on every craft, making your precious materials go further.
3.  It increases **the speed of your gathering and the yield** you collect from **Herbalism and Mining**.

Because of this, acquiring the best tools you can afford is a top priority. Think of it as a foundational investment that pays dividends every time you craft or gather.

#### Available Tools and Accessories:

| Slot | Crafted by | Green | Blue | Epic |
|------|------------|-------|------|------|
| Accessory 1 | Jewelcrafting | [Silvermoon Loupes](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=240955) | [Sin'dorei Jeweler's Loupes](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=240959) | [Mage-Eye Precision Loupes](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=246526) |
| Accessory 2 | Leatherworking | [Apprentice Jeweler's Apron](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244629) | [Sin'dorei Jeweler's Cover](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244630) | [Thalassian Gemshaper's Grand Cover](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244814) |
| Tool | Engineering | [Farstrider Clampers](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244713) | [Sin'dorei Clampers](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244714) | [Super Sin'dorei Clampers](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259181) |


To get started, here is a breakdown of the essential tools and the best enchantments for them:

**High-End Tools (Long-Term Goal)**

I recommend: [Super Sin'dorei Clampers](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259181)

**For Single Items (like Gear):**

I go with **double Resourcefulness**: 
- [Resourcefulness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245817/thalassian-missive-of-resourcefulness) 
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243967/enchant-tool-amani-resourcfulness)

This combo saves you materials when every craft counts.

**For Stackable Stuff (like Reagents):**

This is where I switch to:
- [Multicraft Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245819/thalassian-missive-of-multicraft)
- [Multicraft Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243995/enchant-tool-haranir-multicrafting)

You get the best of both worlds - saving mats AND sometimes getting bonus items!

#### Here's What Actually Happened in My Test:

So, I got enough reagents to make 1000x [Sienna Ink](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245806):

- **With my Resourcefulness setup:** I got 1478x [Sienna Ink](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245806)
- **With my Multicraft setup:** I got 1652x [Sienna Ink](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245806)

The difference was pretty clear - the multicraft setup just gives you more bang for your buck when making stuff in bulk.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Have two tools! One for gear (double Resourcefulness) and one for commodities (double Multicraft). Trust me, it's worth it.

## CONCLUSION

You've now got the complete roadmap to master Jewelcrafting in *Midnight*—from your first prospect to endgame crafting.

Here's what you've learned:

**The Foundation:** Quality tools aren't optional—they're your best investment. Double Resourcefulness for single items, double Multicraft for bulk crafting. This alone will save you thousands of gold over time.

**The Path:** Following this leveling route gets you to skill 60 efficiently, avoiding the common trap of burning gold on recipes that don't scale. From there, you're positioned to craft high-demand profession gear and epic jewelry that actually sells.

**The Reality:** Most players waste weeks figuring this out through trial and error. You just saved yourself that headache.

But here's the thing—**Jewelcrafting doesn't end at skill 100.** The real gold comes from knowing *which* gems are in demand before everyone else does, understanding specialization synergies that maximize your profit margins, and staying ahead of market shifts patch after patch.

That's exactly what our Telegram community is built for—serious crafters who want the edge that comes from being plugged into real-time strategies, not yesterday's guides.
