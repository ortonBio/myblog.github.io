## PROFESSION OVERVIEW

Welcome to the ultimate WoW Midnight fishing guide! Fishing is more than just a relaxing pastime—it's a powerful gold-making profession that provides essential ingredients for Cooking, Alchemy, and valuable rare catches that sell for massive profits on the Auction House.

Your fishing success in *Midnight* depends on three key factors:

1. **Fishing Skill** - Determines what fish you can catch and affects your catch speed
2. **Perception Stat** - Dramatically increases your chances of finding rare and valuable fish
3. **Location Knowledge** - Knowing exactly where and when to fish for maximum efficiency

> *The higher your **FISHING SKILL**, the faster you'll catch fish and the more effectively you can target specific fishing pools. Your **PERCEPTION** stat is crucial for finding rare fish that can sell for thousands of gold each.*

In the *Midnight* expansion, fishing has been enhanced with new mechanics including:

- Specialized fishing lures for targeting specific fish types
- Zone-specific rare fish with unique uses
- Fishing tools and gear that significantly boost your efficiency

Understanding these core mechanics is essential, but knowing the most efficient path to mastery is what separates casual fishers from gold-making experts. Wasting time in the wrong zones or using suboptimal gear is a common mistake—which is exactly what we'll help you avoid.

Let's dive into your optimized fishing journey starting with the essential tools every angler needs.

### PROFESSION TRAINER

You can learn *Midnight* Fishing from **[Drathen](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=253468/drathen)** in **Silvermoon City**.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:**  
> Pair with **[Cooking]()** first. Fish → [Fresh Fillet](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222741) → Buffs like [Ghoulfish Delight](https://www.wowhead.com/item=225855/ghoulfish-delight) (+30 Fishing/Perception, 1hr). Plus, sell feasts.


### ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES

First things first, let's talk about your tools. In *Midnight*, they are more critical than ever. It's not just about leveling up—high-quality tools are essential for saving gold and maximizing your long-term earnings.

A high-quality tool provides three crucial benefits:

1.  It boosts your **SKILL**, which directly determines the quality of the items you produce.
2.  It provides a chance to save reagents on every craft, making your precious materials go further.
3.  It increases **the speed of your gathering and the yield** you collect from **Herbalism, Mining and Fishing**.

Because of this, acquiring the best tools you can afford is a top priority. Think of it as a foundational investment that pays dividends every time you craft or gather.

## LEVELING

### SHOPPING LIST

Before you start your fishing journey, stock up on these consumables to maximize your efficiency:

- [Sanguithorn Tea](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=242299) - Drink to increase your Perception and Speed. Essential for faster casts and better rare fish detection.
- [Haranir Phial of Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=241316) - Drink to increase your Perception and Deftness. Best for pool farming and rare fish hunting.
- [Midnight Phial of Concentrated Ingenuity](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=241314) - Drink to increase your Perception and Speed. Alternative to Sanguithorn Tea with longer duration.

> **Gold-Saving Tip:** Buy these consumables in bulk during off-peak hours (Tuesday/Wednesday mornings). Prices can drop 30-40% when fewer players are online.

### SKILL 1 - 50: Eversong Woods

*   **Zone Overview:** Eversong Woods offers the perfect starting area for new anglers. The tranquil waters near Silvermoon City provide abundant common fish and a gentle learning curve. This zone is ideal for understanding fishing mechanics while building your initial skill foundation.

    *   **Tips:** 
        - Stay near **Silvermoon City** for quick access to the trainer and auction house
        - Fish in pools whenever available—they grant 5x skill-up chances compared to open water
        - Use basic [Shiny Bauble](https://www.wowhead.com/item=6529) if you're struggling with catch rates
        - **Don't waste gold on lures yet**—your natural skill gain is more than sufficient here

### SKILL 50 - 100: Zul'Aman

*   **Zone Overview:** Zul'Aman marks your transition into intermediate fishing. The ancient troll waters contain more valuable catches and introduce you to competitive pool farming. This zone also offers your first chance at profession-specific rare fish that sell for significant gold.

    *   **Tips:** 
        - **This is where Perception gear starts paying off**—rare fish appear 2-3x more frequently with proper stats
        - Fish during off-hours (late night/early morning) to avoid competition

### SKILL 100 - 200: Harandar

*   **Zone Overview:** Harandar is the goldmaking sweet spot for mid-level anglers. The mystical waters of this zone contain high-demand fish used in both raiding consumables and crafting orders. Pool competition intensifies here, so route efficiency becomes critical.

    *   **Tips:** 
        - **This is your primary goldmaking phase**—don't rush past 200 too quickly
        - Use [Midnight Phial of Concentrated Ingenuity](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=241314) constantly—the speed boost lets you hit 20-30% more pools per hour
        - Install the [GatherMate2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gathermate2) addon to track pool spawns and optimize your route


### SKILL 200 - 300: The Voidstorm

*   **Zone Overview:** The Voidstorm represents endgame fishing content. These corrupted waters contain the rarest, most valuable fish in *Midnight*—but also the highest competition. Success here requires optimized gear, consumables, and knowledge of secret fishing spots that most players overlook.

    *   **Tips:** 
        - **You MUST have maxed Perception gear here**—rare fish appear so infrequently that every stat point matters
        - Use [Haranir Phial of Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=241316) + [Ghoulfish Delight](https://www.wowhead.com/item=225855) simultaneously for maximum rare detection

## CONCLUSION

Fishing in *Midnight* isn't just about casting a line and waiting—it's a strategic profession that rewards smart planning, route optimization, and market awareness. 

**Here's your action plan:**

1. **Invest in tools early** (Super Sin'dorei Angler's Rod + Perception enchant)
2. **Follow the leveling route** (don't skip zones—each builds essential skills)
3. **Focus on goldmaking in Harandar** (100-200 is your profit sweet spot)
4. **Master The Voidstorm's secret spots** (Abyssal Depths + Rift's Edge cave)


The difference between an average fisher and a top-tier angler isn't luck—it's knowing *exactly where to fish, when to fish there, and what to do with your catches*.

**But this is just the foundation.**

The real advantage comes from staying ahead of:
- **Market shifts** (knowing when to stockpile vs. when to dump inventory)
- **Patch changes** (new fishing spots, recipe updates, economy impacts)
- **Server-specific strategies** (what sells on YOUR realm, not generic advice)

That's where our **Telegram community** becomes invaluable. While others are reading outdated guides from last patch, you'll know:

✅ Which rare fish prices are about to spike (and when to sell)  
✅ Newly discovered secret fishing spots before they're crowded  
✅ Cross-profession synergies that multiply your gold per hour  
✅ Early warning on nerfs and buffs before patch notes drop

**The best fishers don't just follow guides—they stay connected to a network that keeps them ahead of the curve.**
