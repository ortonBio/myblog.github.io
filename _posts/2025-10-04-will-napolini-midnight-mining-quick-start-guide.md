Let's get crafting.

## PROFESSION OVERVIEW

To create any item in the game, you'll need reagents. The quality of crafted items depends on your profession skill and the quality of materials you use—the higher your skill, the higher the final quality.

> *The higher your **SKILL**, the less **Concentration** you need to spend to craft high-quality items. A higher skill level also allows you to use lower-rank reagents to achieve high-quality results.*

In the latest expansions, professions are also influenced by factors such as:

- Chosen specialization (except Cooking, Fishing, and Archaeology)
- Quality of tools and accessories used

Understanding these rules is one thing, but navigating the *most efficient path* to max skill is another. Wasting reagents on the wrong recipes is a classic gold sink—which is exactly what we'll avoid next. 

Let's map out your optimal leveling guide.

### PROFESSION TRAINER

You can learn *Midnight* Mining from **[Belil](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=241455/belil)** in **Silvermoon City**.

![Mining Trainer Location in Silvermoon City]()

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Additionally, the [Weaver's Tutelage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=442981) and [Weaver's Prodigy](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=462810) buffs, unlocked through [reputation with the Severed Threads faction](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/renown/the-severed-threads), offer a 15% and 30% crafting speed increase respectively, making them highly valuable for mass crafting.

### ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES

First things first: let's talk about your tools. In *Midnight*, they're more critical than ever. It's not just about leveling up—high-quality tools are essential for saving gold and maximizing your long-term earnings.

A high-quality tool provides three crucial benefits:

1. It boosts your **SKILL**, which directly determines the quality of the items you produce.
2. It provides a chance to save reagents on every craft, making your precious materials go further.
3. It increases **the speed of your gathering and the yield** you collect from nodes.

Because of this, acquiring the best tools you can afford is a top priority. Think of it as a foundational investment that pays dividends every time you craft or gather.

#### Available Tools and Accessories

| Slot | Crafted by | Green | Blue | Epic |
|------|------------|-------|------|------|
| Accessory 1 | Engineering | [Farstrider Rock Satchel](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244719) | [Junker's Big Ol' Bag](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244720) | [Super Junker's Big Ol' Bag](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259175/super-junkers-big-ol-bag) |
| Accessory 2 | Engineering | [Farstrider Hardhat](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244715) | [Sin'dorei Gilded Hardhat](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244716) | [Super Sin'dorei Gilded Hardhat](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259173) |
| Tool | Blacksmithing | [Thalassian Pickaxe](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=238010) | [Sun-Blessed Pickaxe](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=238015) | [Sunforged Pickaxe](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=246534) |

To get started, here's a breakdown of the essential tools and the best enchantments for them:

**High-End Tools (Long-Term Goal)**

I recommend: [Sunforged Pickaxe](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=246534)

**For Max Yield (Bulk Gathering):**

I go with **double Finesse**: 

- [Finesse Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245823) 
- [Enchant Tool - Finesse](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243993)

This combo gives you extra ore on every proc—perfect when you're farming routes for gold.

**For Rare Drops (Special Nodes):**

This is where I switch to:
- [Perception Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245825)
- [Enchant Tool - Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243965)

**For Speed Leveling:**

I recommend: [Thalassian Pickaxe](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=238010)

I go with **double Deftness**: 

- [Deftness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245826)
- [Enchant Tool - Deftness](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244023)

This combo **slashes gather time per node**—critical for competitive routes where you're racing other miners or stacking world quests.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Have two tools! One for bulk routes (double Finesse) and one for rare hunting (Perception + Finesse). Trust me, it's worth it.

## ORES OF MIDNIGHT

### Base Ores Overview

Midnight introduces three core ores and their Empowered variations:

#### The Three Base Ores

1. [Refulgent Copper Ore](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=237359)
2. [Brilliant Silver Ore](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=237364)
3. [Umbral Tin Ore](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=237362)

### Empowered Ore Variations

There are three different types of empowered ores you will come across while leveling Mining. These special nodes provide additional benefits beyond standard gathering.

#### 1. Lightfused Ores

A strange light has begun to afflict the ores growing within Quel'thalas. They grow large and golden, reminiscent of the Sunwell itself, but twisted somehow. Gathering these ores yields a searing explosion of holy energy that harms the miner unless they properly learn how to handle the outpouring light.

**Affected Ores:**
- [Lightfused Brilliant Silver](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225359/lightfused-brilliant-silver)
- [Lightfused Refulgent Copper](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225351/lightfused-refulgent-copper)
- [Lightfused Umbral Tin](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225367/lightfused-umbral-tin)

**Drops:** [Mote of Light](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=236949)

**Location:** Can be found in [Eversong Woods](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/zone=15968/eversong-woods)

#### 2. Wild Ores

Gathering these wild ores releases a burst of nature magic, giving rise to a group of hostile ore lashers that attempt to take vengeance!

**Affected Ores:**
- [Wild Brilliant Silver](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225363/wild-brilliant-silver)
- [Wild Refulgent Copper](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225353/wild-refulgent-copper)
- [Wild Umbral Tin](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225368/wild-umbral-tin)

**Drops:** [Mote of Wild Magic](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=236951)

**Location:** Can be found in [Zul'Aman](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/zone=15947/zulaman)

#### 3. Primal Ores

Upon gathering these primal ores, they gift you with some of their energy in the form of additional Vigor for your Skyriding mount.

**Affected Ores:**
- [Primal Brilliant Silver](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225361/primal-brilliant-silver)
- [Primal Refulgent Copper](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225354/primal-refulgent-copper)
- [Primal Umbral Tin](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225369/primal-umbral-tin)

**Drops:** [Mote of Primal Energy](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=236950)

**Location:** Can be found in [Harandar](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/zone=15355/harandar)

#### 4. Voidbound Ores

While the power of the void has been present on Azeroth since time immemorial, recent events have caused it to surge. It has managed to seep into the world, which has had adverse effects on the local ecology. In some cases, the unstable energies of the void have caused these ores to be sent across the Twisting Nether to parts unknown.

**Affected Ores:**
- [Voidbound Brilliant Silver](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225362/voidbound-brilliant-silver)
- [Voidbound Refulgent Copper](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225352/voidbound-refulgent-copper)
- [Voidbound Umbral Tin](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225370/voidbound-umbral-tin)

**Drops:** [Mote of Pure Void](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=236952)

**Location:** Can be found in [Voidstorm](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/zone=15458/voidstorm)

### Ore Overloading Effects

When you gather enough empowered ores of the same type, you trigger an "overloading" effect that provides powerful temporary bonuses.

| Ore Type | Overloading Effect |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **[Wild Ore](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225819/overload-wild-deposits)** | Summons an Avatar of Nalorakk. Defeating it grants a temporary increase to Perception. | 
| **[Voidbound Ore](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225820/overload-voidbound-deposits)** | Introduces more entropy to an already fragile deposit, creating a catastrophic reaction where reality collapses in on itself. Be mindful not to be caught in the middle, or you'll be consumed by the collapse. | 
| **[Primal Ore](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225817/overload-primal-deposits)** | Allows you to channel your health in exchange for Motes of Primal Energy. | 
| **[Lightfused Ore](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1225818/overload-lightfused-deposits)** | Releases motes of holy energy that can be caught for reagents. |

### SKILL 1-100

#### 1-25 (Eversong Woods)

Farm ore in Eversong Woods until skill 25 to unlock Specializations. Then, choose [Meticulous Mining](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/profession-trait/meticulous-mining-105475) and put 40 Knowledge Points into it to gather while mounted.

> 💡 **Note:** You can earn 24 bonus Knowledge Points early on by collecting 8 Mining Treasures in each Midnight Zone.

#### 25-50 (Zul'Aman)

Farm ore in Zul'Aman until you reach skill 50 to unlock your second Specialization. Then, choose [Plentiful Ores](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/profession-trait/plentiful-ores-105568) and allocate 5 Knowledge Points into it to unlock the sub-specialization, then select [Refulgent Copper](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/profession-trait/refulgent-copper-105567).

**Why?** This will allow you to gather more [Refulgent Copper Ore](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=237359), which is heavily used for [Gleaming Copper Ring](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1230489/gleaming-copper-ring) (Disenchanting) and [Refulgent Copper Ingot](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1230761/refulgent-copper-ingot). This high demand makes [Refulgent Copper Ore](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=237359) more valuable than any other ore in the Midnight expansion.

> 💡 **Note:** All ores are valuable, but some are more valuable than others. Prices depend on supply and demand; if the market is flooded with an ore, its price will drop. Generally, the greater the scarcity, the higher the price.

#### 50-75 (Harandar)

Farm ore in Harandar until you reach skill 75 to unlock your third Specialization.

However, do not spend any Knowledge Points until all other specializations are complete.

#### 75-100 (Voidstorm)

From levels 75 to 100, explore Voidstorm to reach the level cap and become familiar with all Midnight zones. You can then choose your favorite one to farm.
