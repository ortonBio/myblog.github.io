## TAILORING TRAINERS

![Tailoring Trainer Map](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759602381/map_vxbebr.png)
*You can learn the War Within Tailoring skill from the Tailoring trainer in Dornogal.*

## INTRODUCTION

To create any item in the game, you'll need reagents. The quality of crafted items depends on your profession SKILL and the quality of materials you use—the higher your SKILL, the higher the final quality.

*Tailoring: A Quick Start Guide - The War Within*

> **The higher SKILL you have the less concentration you have to spend crafting items with high quality**

![Tailoring Overview Banner](/Users/will/Downloads/tailoring.png)
*Tailoring: A Quick Start Guide - The War Within*

> **The higher your skill level, the lower rank of reagents you can use to craft high-quality items.**

In the latest expansions, profession leveling is also influenced by factors such as:
- Chosen specialization
- Quality of tools used

## ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND SETUP

Each main profession can craft profession-specific tools or accessories. High-quality versions require the rare reagent [Artisan's Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210814/artisans-acuity), in addition to standard materials.

> **Blue-quality tools (e.g., for Tailoring, Blacksmithing) require 300 [Artisan's Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210814/artisans-acuity)**

The most reliable ways to obtain [Artisan's Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210814/artisans-acuity) are through Profession Catchup Mechanics:
- Enchanting via [Shimmering Dust](https://www.wowhead.com/item=227662)
- Skinning via [Razor Talon](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224782)

### TOOL CREATION REQUIREMENTS

For creating blue-quality tools, we'll need approximately 900-1500 of [Artisan's Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210814/artisans-acuity), which we'll obtain through the Enchanting profession.

You have two options:
1. Create tools yourself (if you have the necessary recipes and materials)
2. Order from other players through the work order system

### TOOL ENCHANTMENT OPTIONS

When crafting your main tool [Spring-Loaded Aqirite Fabric Cutters](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221787), we have the option to choose characteristics:

**For Single Items:**
- Use combination of [Resourcefulness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222631/algari-missive-of-resourcefulness) + [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223707/enchant-tool-algari-resourcefulness)
- Helps reduce reagent consumption

**For Stackable Items:**
- Focus on [Multicraft](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222634/algari-missive-of-multicraft) + [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223707/enchant-tool-algari-resourcefulness)
- Get more items while saving resources

## LEVELING GUIDE

### SKILL 65 - 100

Between SKILL 65 and 100, you can work on any of these crafts—Optional Reagents, Bags, or Spellthreads—depending on which recipes you have unlocked.

If you're not too concerned about losing gold, crafting the [Duskthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=446992) or [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=446991) is a good option.

If you have a lot of alts, crafting bags like [The Severed Satchel](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=454431/the-severed-satchel) might be the best option.

### SKILL 98 - 100

You can reach SKILL level 100 by crafting Optional Reagents, Bags, or Spellthreads.

However, progress may slow down significantly for the last levels if your recipes don't yield SKILL points consistently.

Also, if you have a Renown 5 with [*The K'aresh Trust*](https://www.wowhead.com/faction=2658/the-karesh-trust), you can craft [Pure Chronomantic Fiber](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1228344/pure-chronomatic-fiber) to get the final points you need.

### How to Use Tailoring Specializations

Each tailoring specialization focuses on a different aspect of the profession. Choose the build that matches your playstyle and goals:

- **Cloth Farmer**: Best for gathering raw materials efficiently
- **Unraveling**: Optimal for extracting maximum value from existing items
