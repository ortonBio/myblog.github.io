Let's get started.

## TAILORING TRAINERS

*You can learn the War Within Tailoring skill from the Tailoring trainer [Kotag](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/npc=219094/kotag) in Dornogal*

![Tailoring Trainer Map](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759604009/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-trainer-map_ph8fwl.png)

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Craft higher-tier recipes while they still give SKILL points. This efficiently claims their mandatory first-time bonus while you still get leveling progress from them.

## PROFESSION OVERVIEW

To create any item in the game, you'll need reagents. The quality of crafted items depends on your profession SKILL and the quality of materials you useâ€”the higher your SKILL, the higher the final quality.

In the latest expansions, professions is also influenced by factors such as:

- Chosen specialization
- Quality of tools used

![Tailoring Overview Banner](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759603484/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-skill_n1z8rn.png)
> *The higher SKILL you have the less concentration you have to spend crafting items with high quality*

![Tailoring Overview Banner](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759604339/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-skill-quality_zlyvgh.png)
> *The higher your skill level, the lower rank of reagents you can use to craft high-quality items.*

### ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES

Each main profession can craft profession-specific tools or accessories. High-quality versions require the rare reagent [Artisan's Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210814/artisans-acuity), in addition to standard materials.

![Blue-quality tools](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759604752/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-artisans-acuity_kyytxn.png)

> **Blue-quality tools (e.g., for Tailoring, Blacksmithing) require 300 [Artisan's Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210814/artisans-acuity)**

The most reliable ways to obtain [Artisan's Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210814/artisans-acuity) are through Profession Catchup Mechanics:
- Enchanting via [Shimmering Dust](https://www.wowhead.com/item=227662)
- Skinning via [Razor Talon](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224782)

For more info check this guide [Artisan's Acuity: Quick Start Guide](Link)

#### TOOL CREATION REQUIREMENTS

For creating blue-quality tools, we'll need approximately 900-1500 of [Artisan's Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210814/artisans-acuity), which we can obtain through the [Enchanting]() profession.

You have two options:
1. Create tools yourself (if you have the necessary recipes and materials)
2. Order from other players through the work order system

![Crafting Tools](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759606092/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-crafting-tools_wm6vmp.png)

#### TOOL ENCHANTMENT OPTIONS

So you've got your fancy [Spring-Loaded Aqirite Fabric Cutters](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221787) - nice! 

Now, what enchantments should you use? From my testing, it really depends on what you're crafting.

**For Single Items (like gear):**
I go with **double resourcefulness**: 
- [Resourcefulness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222631) 
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223707)

This combo saves you materials when every craft counts.

**For Stackable Stuff (like cloth bolts):**
This is where I switch to:
- [Multicraft Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222634)
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223707)

You get the best of both worlds - saving mats AND sometimes getting bonus items!

#### Here's What Actually Happened in My Test:

So, I got enough reagents to make 1000x [Weavercloth Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222804):

- **With my single-item setup (31% Resourcefulness and 10% Multicraft):** I got 1478x [Weavercloth Bolts](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222804)
- **With my stackable-item setup (19% Resourcefulness and 20% Multicraft):** I got 1652x [Weavercloth Bolts](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222804)

The difference was pretty clear - the multicraft setup just gives you more bang for your buck when making stuff in bulk.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Have two tools! One for gear (double resourcefulness) and one for commodities (multicraft + resourcefulness). Trust me, it's worth it.

#### Available Tailoring Tools and Accessories:

> **Note:** The recipe will turn green at SKILL 62 and grey at 65. To get the last few SKILL points, you will likely have to craft multiple items.

### SKILL 65 - 100

Between SKILL 65 and 100, you can work on any of these craftsâ€”Optional Reagents, Bags, or Spellthreadsâ€”depending on which recipes you have unlocked.

![Dawnthread Lining](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759619457/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-dawnthread-lining_wbt5vl.png)

If you're not too concerned about losing gold, crafting the [Duskthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=446992) or [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=446991) is a good option.

![Dawnthread Lining](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759619285/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-auction_hqf6xg.png)

> **Note:** [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=446991) recipe can be bought on the Auction House. It requires a SKILL level of 35 to learn.

If you have a lot of alts, crafting bags like [The Severed Satchel](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=454431/the-severed-satchel) might be the best option.

### SKILL 98 - 100

You can reach SKILL level 100 by crafting Optional Reagents, Bags, or Spellthreads.

However, progress may slow down significantly for the last levels if your recipes don't yield SKILL points consistently.

Also, if you have a Renown 5 with [*The K'aresh Trust*](https://www.wowhead.com/faction=2658/the-karesh-trust), you can craft [Pure Chronomantic Fiber](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1228344/pure-chronomatic-fiber) to get the final points you need.

![Pure Chronomantic Fiber](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759619608/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-pure-chronomantic-fiber_elbd7x.png)

#### Gearcrafter
The ultimate specialization for creating powerful cloth armor and accessories. This build unlocks exclusive patterns, increases the chance to craft higher-quality gear, and adds special bonuses to created items.

### How to Use Tailoring Specializations

Each tailoring specialization focuses on a different aspect of the profession. Choose the build that matches your playstyle and goals:

- **Cloth Farmer**: Best for gathering raw materials efficiently
- **Unraveling**: Optimal for extracting maximum value from existing items
- **Boltmaker**: Perfect for mass production of intermediate materials
- **Gearcrafter**: Ideal for creating high-end armor and accessories

You can switch between specializations, but changing may have a cooldown or cost associated with it.

### EVERGREEN RECIPES

These Tailoring recipes remain valuable throughout the expansion because they're always in demand. Bags are essential for every player, and crafting them provides consistent gold income regardless of the current raid tier or season. Once you learn these patterns, you'll have reliable crafting options that never go out of style.

### KNOWLEDGE POINTS SOURCES

#### TRAINER

First of all, you get your first Knowledge Points by simply crafting each new recipe once.

![First Craft](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759874424/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-first-craft_bpsaam.png)

> **Pro Tip:** [Myu's Weak Aura](https://wago.io/L7lpDrqUO) for tracking Profession Knowledge. Fantastic for tracking available profession knowledge, especially catchup.

#### Treasures
Each treasure gives us **+3 Knowledge Points** (24 total).

In the list below, I've included all Tailoring treasure locations. I highly recommend using the [TomTom](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom) and [WeakAuras](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2) addons for time efficiency.

**Tailoring Knowledge Treasures:**
*   **[Dornogal Seam Ripper](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=226348/dornogal-seam-ripper)** - Inside a building in Dornogal.
*   **[Earthen Tape Measure](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=226349/earthen-tape-measure)** - On the Isle of Dorn, in the Boulder Springs area.
*   **[Earthen Stitcher's Snips](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=226351/earthen-stitchers-snips)** - In the Ringing Deeps, near Taelloch.
*   **[Runed Earthen Pins](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=226350/runed-earthen-pins)** - Inside the innkeeper's inn in Gundargaz (Ringing Deeps). Don't just look outside!
*   **[Arathi Rotary Cutter](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=226352/arathi-rotary-cutter)** - In Hallowfall, at Beledar's Bounty.
*   **[Royal Outfitter's Protractor](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=226353/royal-outfitters-protractor)** - Also in Hallowfall, up in Light's Redoubt.
*   **[Nerubian Quilt](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=226354/nerubian-quilt)** - Located in Azj-Kahet, in the Silken Ward.
*   **[Nerubian's Pincushion](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=226355/nerubians-pincushion)** - Found in the City of Threads, specifically in the Umbral Bazaar.

**TomTom Coordinates:**
Just copy and paste these into your `/ttpaste` window!

#### VENDORS BOOKS

The treasures are great, but the real knowledge jackpot comes from the books you can buy. Just like the treasures, these are **one-time purchases per character**. Once you buy them, they're gone from the vendor for you.

Each of these books gives a whopping **+10 Knowledge Points** (70 total).

Here's a breakdown of them all:

#### CRAFTING ORDERS

Completing crafting orders for Artisan's Consortium can reward you with tailoring knowledge points. 

![Crafting Orders](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759873587/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-crafting-orders_a5t9ld.png)

## HELPFUL ADDONS

Alright, let's talk tools. I've spent a ton of time tweaking my setup, and these are the addons and tricks I genuinely can't play without. They save me hours and make the gold-making grind feel smooth and even fun.

### My Best Friend for Treasure Hunting: [TomTom](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom) 

If you're following any of my treasure guides, do yourself a favor and get [TomTom](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom). I promise it's a game-changer. Trying to find things using just coordinates is a pain, and this little addon completely solves that.

**Where I Get It:**
I just grab it from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com). If you use the CurseForge app like I do, it's even easierâ€”just a quick search and install.

**How I Use It (The Easy Way):**
This is my standard routine:
1.  I copy the big list of `/way` commands from one of my guides.
2.  In-game, I just type `/ttpaste` into chat. (Make sure there's no space before it!).
3.  A little window pops up, I paste the list in there, and hit "Paste."

Boom! Suddenly your map is filled with helpful little green dots showing you exactly where to go. If that ever glitches on you, you can always just copy and paste each line directly into your chat, like this:

`/way #2339 61.5 18.5 Dornogal Seam Ripper`

**A Few Things I've Learned:**

*   **Checking for Loot:** I include those "treasure check" commands so you can see if you've already looted something. Just paste them in the same `/ttpaste` window. If it says 'true,' you're good to go!

*   **Minimap Quirks:** The treasures *do* show up on your minimap, but if one is hiding inside a cave or building, sometimes you have to get really close for it to pop up.

*   **The Best Part:** You don't need to be a master crafter or at max level! I've looted these on alts with skill level 1. It's the perfect way to get a new character started.

---

### My Gold-Making Toolkit

This is my personal arsenal. These are the addons that are always running on my main and bank alts.

*   **[TradeSkillMaster (TSM)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tradeskill-master):** This is the backbone of my entire operation. It looks complicated, but for managing the auction house, there's nothing better. I also use it for mailing stuff between charactersâ€”it saves so much time.

*   **[Auctionator](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctionator):** Sometimes TSM feels like overkill for a quick post. Auctionator is my go-to for its clean, powerful, and straightforward interface.

*   **[Craftsim](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/craftsim):** Since Dragonflight launched, this addon is non-negotiable for me as a crafter. It tells me the cheapest way to make something and what's actually profitable.

*   **[Mass Salvage Assist]():** I hate clicking. This lets me prospect a whole bag of ore or mill a stack of herbs in one click. It's a simple addon, but my wrist thanks me for it.

*   **[Craftscan](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mass-salvage-assist):** If you're doing crafting orders in trade chat, you need this. It makes the whole process so much smoother. [Here's the link I use to get it.](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/craftscan)

*   **[Buyemall](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/buyemall):** I craft a lot of things that need vendor mats. This addon lets me buy 20000 threads at once instead of clicking over and over. It's a tiny thing, but I love it.

*   **[Fasterloot](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/fasterloot):** It just makes looting feel snappier. It's great for farming runs.

*   **[No Mats No Make](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nomatsnomake):** A super simple quality-of-life addon that makes checking crafting order requirements way easier.

*   **[Patron Offers](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/poff):** Patron Offers enhances the crafting order list by showing required reagents, final rewards, and highlighting special orders like first-craft bonuses and potential skill-ups.

*   **[Profession Shopping List](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/profession-shopping-list):** I use this all the time when I'm fulfilling a bunch of work orders and need to see what mats I'm missing across all my characters.

*   **[Point Blank Sniper](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/point-blank-sniper):** My favorite sniper addon. It's clean, effective, and has found me some insane deals.

*   **[Baganator](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/baganator):** I've tried every bag addon, and this is the one that stuck. Being able to create custom groups is perfect for keeping my banker's bags organized.

*   **[Routes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/routes):** When I'm in a farming mood, I pair this with [Gathermate]() to create the most efficient loops. It maximizes my yield every time.

*   **[Worthit](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/worthit):** I use this to get a rough idea if a farm is worth my time. It averages out my loot and gives me a Gold Per Hour estimate using my TSM data.

*   **[WeakAuras](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2):** A powerful, comprehensive utilty for displaying graphics and information based on buffs, debuffs, and other triggers.

---

#### [WeakAuras](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2)

A couple of final touches that make my life easier.

**My Go-To WeakAura:**

*   **[Myu's Profession Knowledge Tracker](https://wago.io/L7lpDrqUO):** I have this running on all my crafters. It's brilliant for tracking my knowledge gains, especially the catch-up stuff. 

[You can get it here.](https://wago.io/L7lpDrqUO)

![WeakAuras Infographic](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1759879612/will-napolini-tailoring-quick-start-guide-weakauras-addon_yswbam.png)

**How To Use It (The Easy Way):**

1. It shows us our profession
2. Shows us Knowledge Point Source
3. Shows us Location/Zone

That's my complete setup! I hope you find some of these as useful as I have. Let me know if you have any personal favorites I should check out
