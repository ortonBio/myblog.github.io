Let’s get crafting.

## PROFESSION OVERVIEW

To create any item in the game, you'll need reagents. The quality of crafted items depends on your profession skill and the quality of materials you use — the higher your skill, the higher the final quality.

> *The higher your **SKILL**, the less **Concentration** you need to spend to craft high-quality items. A higher skill level also allows you to use lower-rank reagents to achieve high-quality results.*

In the latest expansions, professions are also influenced by factors such as:

- Chosen specialization (except Cooking, Fishing and Archaeology)
- Quality of tools and accessories used

Understanding these rules is one thing, but navigating the *most efficient path* to max skill is another. Wasting reagents on the wrong recipes is a classic gold sink—which is exactly what we'll avoid next. 

Let's map out your optimal leveling guide.

### PROFESSION TRAINER

You can learn *Midnight* Blacksmithing from **[Bemarrin](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=241450/bemarrin)** in **Silvermoon City**.

![Blacksmithing Trainer Location in Silvermoon City](1.png)

> 💡 **Pro Tip:**
> Before diving deep into your primary profession, it’s highly recommended to learn **[Enchanting](https://www.wowhead.com/skill=333/enchanting)** first.
> By unlocking **[Shimmering Dust](https://www.wowhead.com/item=227662/shimmering-dust)** through disenchanting, you can obtain **x5 [Artisan’s Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210814/artisans-acuity)** per dust. These reagents are crucial for crafting profession gear, making your entire leveling process smoother and more efficient.


### ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES

First things first, let's talk about your tools. In *Midnight*, they are more critical than ever. It's not just about leveling up—high-quality tools are essential for saving gold and maximizing your long-term earnings.

A high-quality tool provides three crucial benefits:

1.  It boosts your **SKILL**, which directly determines the quality of the items you produce.
2.  It provides a chance to save reagents on every craft, making your precious materials go further.
3.  It increases **the speed of your gathering and the yield** you collect from **Herbalism and Mining**.

Because of this, acquiring the best tools you can afford is a top priority. Think of it as a foundational investment that pays dividends every time you craft or gather.

To get started, here is a breakdown of the essential tools and the best enchantments for them:

**High-End Tools (Long-Term Goal)**

I recommend: [Sunforged Blacksmith's Hammer](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=246537/sunforged-blacksmiths-hammer)

**For Single Items (like Gear):**

I go with **double Resourcefulness**: 
- [Resourcefulness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245817/thalassian-missive-of-resourcefulness) 
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243967/enchant-tool-amani-resourcfulness)

This combo saves you materials when every craft counts.

**For Stackable Stuff (like Reagents):**

This is where I switch to:
- [Multicraft Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245819/thalassian-missive-of-multicraft)
- [Multicraft Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243995/enchant-tool-haranir-multicrafting)

You get the best of both worlds - saving mats AND sometimes getting bonus items!

#### Here's What Actually Happened in My Test:

So, I got enough reagents to make 1000x [Refulgent Copper Ingot](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=238198):

- **With my single-item setup:** I got 1478x [Refulgent Copper Ingot](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=238198)
- **With my stackable-item setup:** I got 1652x [Refulgent Copper Ingot](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=238198)

The difference was pretty clear - the multicraft setup just gives you more bang for your buck when making stuff in bulk.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Have two tools! One for gear (double Resourcefulness) and one for commodities (double Multicraft). Trust me, it's worth it.
