Let’s get crafting.

## PROFESSION OVERVIEW

To create any item in the game, you'll need reagents. The quality of crafted items depends on your profession skill and the quality of materials you use — the higher your skill, the higher the final quality.

> *The higher your **SKILL**, the less **Concentration** you need to spend to craft high-quality items. A higher skill level also allows you to use lower-rank reagents to achieve high-quality results.*

In the latest expansions, professions are also influenced by factors such as:

- Chosen specialization (except Cooking, Fishing and Archaeology)
- Quality of tools and accessories used

Understanding these rules is one thing, but navigating the *most efficient path* to max skill is another. Wasting reagents on the wrong recipes is a classic gold sink—which is exactly what we'll avoid next. 

Let's map out your optimal leveling guide.

### PROFESSION TRAINER

You can learn *Midnight* Leatherworking from **[Talmar](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=243500/talmar)** in **Silvermoon City**.

![Leatherworking Trainer Location in Silvermoon City](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlkv9y3s2/image/upload/v1761414098/will-napolini-Leatherworking-quick-start-guide-trainer-map_nejowg.png)

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Additionally, the [Weaver’s Tutelage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=442981) and [Weaver’s Prodigy](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=462810) buffs, unlocked through [reputation with the Severed Threads faction](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/renown/the-severed-threads), offer a 15% and 30% crafting speed increase respectively, making them highly valuable for mass crafting.


### ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES

First things first, let's talk about your tools. In *Midnight*, they are more critical than ever. It's not just about leveling up—high-quality tools are essential for saving gold and maximizing your long-term earnings.

A high-quality tool provides three crucial benefits:

1.  It boosts your **SKILL**, which directly determines the quality of the items you produce.
2.  It provides a chance to save reagents on every craft, making your precious materials go further.
3.  It increases **the speed of your gathering and the yield** you collect from **Herbalism and Mining**.

Because of this, acquiring the best tools you can afford is a top priority. Think of it as a foundational investment that pays dividends every time you craft or gather.

#### Available Tools and Accessories:

| Slot | Crafted by | Green | Blue | Epic |
|------|------------|-------|------|------|
| Accessory 1 | Blacksmithing | [Thalassian Leatherworker's Toolset](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=237947) | [Sun-Blessed Leatherworker's Toolset](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=237951) | [Sunforged Leatherworker's Toolset](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=259232) |
| Accessory 2 | Leatherworking | [Hideworker's Cover](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244619) | [Sin'dorei Leathershaper's Smock](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244625) | [Thalassian Hideshaper's Regalia](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244811) |
| Tool | Blacksmithing | [Thalassian Leatherworker's Knife](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=238012) | [Sun-Blessed Leatherworker's Knife](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=238017) | [Sunforged Leatherworker's Knife](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=246536) |

To get started, here is a breakdown of the essential tools and the best enchantments for them:

**High-End Tools (Long-Term Goal)**

I recommend: [Sunforged Leatherworker's Knife](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=246536)

**For Single Items (like Gear):**

I go with **double Resourcefulness**: 
- [Resourcefulness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245817/thalassian-missive-of-resourcefulness) 
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243967/enchant-tool-amani-resourcfulness)

This combo saves you materials when every craft counts.

**For Stackable Stuff (like Reagents):**

This is where I switch to:
- [Multicraft Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245819/thalassian-missive-of-multicraft)
- [Multicraft Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243995/enchant-tool-haranir-multicrafting)

You get the best of both worlds - saving mats AND sometimes getting bonus items!

#### Here's What Actually Happened in My Test:

So, I got enough reagents to make 1000x [Scalewoven Hide](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244631):

-   **With my single-item setup:** I got 1322x [Scalewoven Hide](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244631)
-   **With my stackable-item setup:** I got 1444x [Scalewoven Hide](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244631)

The difference was pretty clear - the multicraft setup just gives you more bang for your buck when making stuff in bulk.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Have two tools! One for gear (double Resourcefulness) and one for commodities (double Multicraft). Trust me, it's worth it.
