Let’s get crafting.

## PROFESSION OVERVIEW

To create any item in the game, you'll need reagents. The quality of crafted items depends on your profession skill and the quality of materials you use — the higher your skill, the higher the final quality.

> *The higher your **SKILL**, the less **Concentration** you need to spend to craft high-quality items. A higher skill level also allows you to use lower-rank reagents to achieve high-quality results.*

In the latest expansions, professions are also influenced by factors such as:

- Chosen specialization (except Cooking, Fishing and Archaeology)
- Quality of tools and accessories used

Understanding these rules is one thing, but navigating the *most efficient path* to max skill is another. Wasting reagents on the wrong recipes is a classic gold sink—which is exactly what we'll avoid next. 

Let's map out your optimal leveling guide.

### PROFESSION TRAINER

You can learn *Midnight* Enchanting from **[Dolothos](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=243349/dolothos)** in **Silvermoon City**.

![Enchanting Trainer Location in Silvermoon City](1.png)

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Additionally, the [Weaver’s Tutelage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=442981) and [Weaver’s Prodigy](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=462810) buffs, unlocked through [reputation with the Severed Threads faction](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/renown/the-severed-threads), offer a 15% and 30% crafting speed increase respectively, making them highly valuable for mass crafting.


### ESSENTIAL TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES

First things first, let's talk about your tools. In *Midnight*, they are more critical than ever. It's not just about leveling up—high-quality tools are essential for saving gold and maximizing your long-term earnings.

A high-quality tool provides three crucial benefits:

1.  It boosts your **SKILL**, which directly determines the quality of the items you produce.
2.  It provides a chance to save reagents on every craft, making your precious materials go further.
3.  It increases **the speed of your gathering and the yield** you collect from **Herbalism and Mining**.

Because of this, acquiring the best tools you can afford is a top priority. Think of it as a foundational investment that pays dividends every time you craft or gather.

To get started, here is a breakdown of the essential tools and the best enchantments for them:

**High-End Tools (Long-Term Goal)**

I recommend: [Runed Dazzling Thorium Rod](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=244177)

**For Single Items (like Gear Enchants):**

I go with **double Resourcefulness**: 
- [Resourcefulness Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245817) 
- [Resourcefulness Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243967)

This combo saves you materials when every craft counts.

**For Stackable Stuff (like Reagents):**

This is where I switch to:
- [Multicraft Missive](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=245819)
- [Multicraft Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=243995)

You get the best of both worlds - saving mats AND sometimes getting bonus items!

#### Here's What Actually Happened in My Test:

So, I got enough reagents to make 1000x [Thalassian Phoenix Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1236491/thalassian-phoenix-oil):

- **With my Resourcefulness setup:** I got 6541x [Thalassian Phoenix Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1236491/thalassian-phoenix-oil)
- **With my Multicraft setup:** I got 6830x [Thalassian Phoenix Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1236491/thalassian-phoenix-oil)

The difference was pretty clear - the multicraft setup just gives you more bang for your buck when making stuff in bulk.

> **Pro Tip:** 
> Have two tools—one for maximum [Resourcefulness](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1265693/resourcefulness) and one for maximum [Multicraft](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=1265601/multicraft). Trust me, it's worth it.

### Leveling 

### Racials
*   **Blood Elf**: +5 Enchanting skill
*   **Kul Tiran**: +2 Enchanting skill

More Enchanting skill means more orange recipe skill-ups, saving gold and improving high-quality reagent chances from disenchanting.

### Disenchanting
Disenchant any leftover gear from questing or dungeons before you start leveling. Disenchanting can give skill points up to 25.

## CONCLUSION

You've just mapped out the most efficient path to level 100 in Enchanting—no wasted gold, no outdated advice, just the exact route that works in *Midnight* right now.

**Here's what you've learned:**

- The essential tools that turn every craft into profit (double Resourcefulness for gear, Multicraft for bulk reagents)
- A precise shopping list and leveling path from 1 to 100
- The specialization unlock that cuts your costs at skill 50
- High-demand enchants that actually sell (because what's the point of leveling if you can't make gold?)

But here's the reality: **patches change everything.** Today's meta becomes tomorrow's gold sink. Recipes get nerfed. New farms get discovered. Markets shift overnight.

The smart enchanters don't just follow guides—they stay plugged into what's *actually working* before everyone else catches on.

That's exactly what our Telegram community is for. While others are scrambling to figure out what changed after a patch, our members already know:

✅ Which enchants to stockpile before demand spikes  
✅ Real-time market shifts and arbitrage opportunities  
✅ Specialization meta changes that affect your gold per hour  
✅ The secret farms and routes top gold makers actually use

**This guide gave you the foundation. The community keeps you ahead.**
